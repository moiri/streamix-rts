# `v0.2.1` (latest)

### Bug Fixes
 - fix deadline miss reports on non-TT nets (#16)

### Changes

 - Remove XML configuration
 - Remove Streamix-based profiling
 - Improve deadline detection handling (#16)
 - Remove the message type `tsmem` from the RTS and created an external library
   instead (`libsmxmsgtsmem`)

### New Features
 - Allow to configure the RTS with a JSON file instead of XML (#17)
 - Create a small configuration API which allows to easily access keys in a
   JSON configuration file
 - Allow to address each net instance in configuration (#14)
 - Allow for sub-configuration files (#7)
 - Add profiling capabilities with [lttng](https://lttng.org/) (#13)
 - Allow to check for the reason if a channel read or write operation fails (#8)
 - Add a test environment that allows to run a single box implementation (#12)
 - Add a type field to the message structure.
 - Add a macro to access the implementation name.


-------------------
# `v0.1.0`

### Bug Fixes
 - fix the TF read function (#1)
 - fix the termination behaviour of TF
 - fix the termination behaviour of RN
 - Handle potential seg-faults by checking for null pointers consistently
 - fix mutex locking and unlocking
 - fix collector counter

### Changes
 - Cleanup cond vars (move the cond var from fifo to channel level)
 - Use a common net structure to store information every net has
 - Create channel ends to better distinguish between read and write operations
 - Add new FIFO types to handle special case of TFs (see #1)
 - Cope with open ports by allowing a channel to be `NULL`
 - Pass net handler to msg macros and cleanup function
 - Restructuring of `smx_tf` to make it more similar to a normal net
 - Synchronize initialisation with a `pthread_barrier`
 - Adapt to cope with c template files generated by `smxrtsp`
 - Change the license from GPL-v3.0 to MPL-v2.0

### New Features
 - Add a `unpack` function to the message callbacks
 - Allow to configure the RTS with an XML file (path to the file can be passed
   by parameter)
 - Pass net-specific configuration to the net instance
 - Each custom net must now define an init and cleanup function
 - Propagate termination signals in both directions
 - Use zlog categories to distinguish between different concept
 - Include multiple log levels
 - Make the routing node fair when reading from inputs (a rn has now state)
 - Allow to configure whether a TF copies msgs on DL miss of the producer or
   sends a NULL msg (if copy is enabled every msg has to be backed up)
 - Run TF and TF-framed nets as RT-Tasks with different priorities
 - Add profiling capabilities (requires a box to capture the profiling events,
   e.g. `smx_mogo`)
 - At the end of an app execution log execution time and box execution counts
