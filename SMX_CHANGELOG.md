# `v0.5.4` (latest)

### Bug Fixes

 - fix test dataset indexing

### Changes

 - log net execution count


-------------------
# `v0.5.3` (latest)

### Changes

 - allocate/free channel name


-------------------
# `v0.5.2`

### Changes

 - allocate/free net and impl name


-------------------
# `v0.5.1`

### Bug Fixes

 - fix memory leak
 - protect content filter setter with mutex


-------------------
# `v0.5.0`

### Bug Fixes

 - improve log messages
 - fix config parser

### Changes

 - handle the log config file in a similar way as the app config file (by
   passing it as app parameter)

### New Features

 - add a log level 'event'
 - add support for channel read and write timeouts
 - allow to dynamically configure each net


-------------------
# `v0.4.0`

### Bug Fixes

 - check whether channel is null before setting type filter
 - use the maximum net degree from the signature and the graph

### Changes

 - don't use pthread functions in header to avoid unnecessary dependencies
 - add log messages before and after init barrier
 - use specific zlog version
 - add debian revision to config
 - remove default zlog file (added to zlog package)
 - fix doxygen config
 - use debian install locations
 - seperate config.mk and Makefile
 - update to new debian files


-------------------
# `v0.3.2`

### Bug Fixes

 - now, general boolean properties of a net are read correctly.
 - first check message type filter, then check message content filter.


-------------------
# `v0.3.1`

### Changes

 - Log version numbers on level NOTICE.
 - Log RTS version number.


-------------------
# `v0.3.0`

### Bug Fixes

 - fix some typos
 - exclude channel macro to set content filter from testing clause

### New Features

 - Allow to configure whether a message is backed up in a decoupled channel.


-------------------
# `v0.2.1`

### Bug Fixes

 - fix deadline miss reports on non-TT nets (#16)

### Changes

 - Remove XML configuration
 - Remove Streamix-based profiling
 - Improve deadline detection handling (#16)
 - Remove the message type `tsmem` from the RTS and created an external library
   instead (`libsmxmsgtsmem`)

### New Features

 - Allow to configure the RTS with a JSON file instead of XML (#17)
 - Create a small configuration API which allows to easily access keys in a
   JSON configuration file
 - Allow to address each net instance in configuration (#14)
 - Allow for sub-configuration files (#7)
 - Add profiling capabilities with [lttng](https://lttng.org/) (#13)
 - Allow to check for the reason if a channel read or write operation fails (#8)
 - Add a test environment that allows to run a single box implementation (#12)
 - Add a type field to the message structure.
 - Add a macro to access the implementation name.
 - Add a utility function to filter message types.
 - Add generic message type and message content filter functionality that acts
   upon writing a message to a channel. For reasons of performance, the type
   filter can be disabled globally with a boolean config option `type_filter`.


-------------------
# `v0.1.0`

### Bug Fixes

 - fix the TF read function (#1)
 - fix the termination behaviour of TF
 - fix the termination behaviour of RN
 - Handle potential seg-faults by checking for null pointers consistently
 - fix mutex locking and unlocking
 - fix collector counter

### Changes

 - Cleanup cond vars (move the cond var from fifo to channel level)
 - Use a common net structure to store information every net has
 - Create channel ends to better distinguish between read and write operations
 - Add new FIFO types to handle special case of TFs (see #1)
 - Cope with open ports by allowing a channel to be `NULL`
 - Pass net handler to msg macros and cleanup function
 - Restructuring of `smx_tf` to make it more similar to a normal net
 - Synchronize initialisation with a `pthread_barrier`
 - Adapt to cope with c template files generated by `smxrtsp`
 - Change the license from GPL-v3.0 to MPL-v2.0

### New Features

 - Add a `unpack` function to the message callbacks
 - Allow to configure the RTS with an XML file (path to the file can be passed
   by parameter)
 - Pass net-specific configuration to the net instance
 - Each custom net must now define an init and cleanup function
 - Propagate termination signals in both directions
 - Use zlog categories to distinguish between different concept
 - Include multiple log levels
 - Make the routing node fair when reading from inputs (a rn has now state)
 - Allow to configure whether a TF copies msgs on DL miss of the producer or
   sends a NULL msg (if copy is enabled every msg has to be backed up)
 - Run TF and TF-framed nets as RT-Tasks with different priorities
 - Add profiling capabilities (requires a box to capture the profiling events,
   e.g. `smx_mogo`)
 - At the end of an app execution log execution time and box execution counts
